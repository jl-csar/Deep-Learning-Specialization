# Deep-Learning-Specialization

### Description

This repo contains all the code assignments I finished in [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) which is taught by Andrew Ng in Coursera. This contains only the traning notebooks not including the datasets and dependencies.

Upon completion of the program, the learner is expected to:

- Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to your applications

- Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow

- Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning

- Build a Convolutional Neural Network, apply it to visual detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply these algorithms to image, video, and other 2D/3D data

- Build and train Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants (GRUs, LSTMs), apply RNNs to character-level language modeling, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformers to perform Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering
